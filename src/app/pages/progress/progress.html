			Progress
		</single-subheading-title>

			The world in which we work is changing, and so is the definition of success. It’s no longer about reaching a fixed point, but harnessing motion to keep moving forward: ensuring constant progress for the brands we represent and the stories we tell.<br><br>

			In a world defined by motion, it’s not enough to measure static volumes like column inches and unique users. We track those of course, but what we’re principally concerned with is progress: what it takes to keep moving forward. The traditional metrics still matter, but we also need to look at who our stories are reaching, what influence they are having and what channels, audiences and geographies they are moving through.<br><br>
			 
			Momentum is a new way of working and it demands a new method of measurement to reflect its value. That’s why we examine the likes of behaviour change, sales impact and consumer attitudes.<br><br>
			 
			Progress for a brand in motion is about far more than stories. It’s about impact, on the people, communities and industries that they interact with. A brand in positive motion is making a difference across its entire universe, moving people, debates and perceptions.<br><br>
			 
			Which is why WE will never just talk about making its clients heard. We’re only satisfied when we know we’ve helped them to make progress, and make a difference.
