			The definition of success is changing. It’s no longer about reaching a milestone. It’s about moving forward, and ensuring progress for the brands we represent: for the stakeholders and for their own success.<br><br>
			In a world defined by motion, it’s not enough to measure static volumes like stories and unique users. We track those of course, but what we’re principally concerned with is progress: what it takes to keep moving forward. The traditional metrics still matter, but we also need to look at who our stories are reaching, what influence they are having and what channels, audiences and geographies they are moving through.<br><br>

					<p>Momentum is a new way of working and it demands a new method of measurement to reflect its progress. That’s why we examine behavior change, sales impact and consumer attitudes.<br><br>
					Progress for a brand in motion is about far more than stories. It’s about impact, on the people, communities and industries that they interact with. A brand in positive motion is making a difference across its entire universe, moving people, debates and perceptions.</p>
