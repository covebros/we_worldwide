	<single-subheading-text>
		When we relaunched as WE in 2015, we changed our visual identity and solidified our position as an agency at the intersection of people, brands and technology.<br><br>
		Fast-forward to 2017, when we recognized we needed intellectual property to underpin our brand â€“ a rationale behind our core strength: transformative storytelling.<br><br> 
		We wanted to be able to answer the perennial client question: So HOW exactly can you help my brand?

		Progress
	</single-subheading-title>
	<single-subheading-text>
		Our intellectual property provides WE with a selling differentiator and offers clients a competitive advantage by delivering them progress.<br><br>
		Progress is something we all strive for: whether for ourselves, for our communities or the wider world.<br><br> 
		Our point of view (Brands in Motion), methodology (Momentum) and an array of solutions (Stories in Motion) interconnect both internally and externally to help brands and their stakeholders make progress in a world of accelerated motion.
