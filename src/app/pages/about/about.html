			The starting point

		<single-subheading-text>
			How do we cut through the noise? What should we invest in? How exactly does this help my brand again?<br><br>
			They are the age-old client questions, but in a changing world they need new answers. Every brand today faces a world in motion: stories, stakeholders, competitors and culture constantly changing and always on the move. It’s a speed of change that the old, static methods can’t cope with.<br><br> 
			When every business faces disruption and dislocation as an everyday reality, change cannot be avoided: the only option is to move with it.

			Our response
		</single-subheading-title>
		<single-subheading-text>
			That’s why we have developed a new approach to meet the challenges posed by a world of brands and stories in motion. It’s a toolkit for delivering better in a more demanding environment. A methodology that underpins everything WE are and everything WE do, every day. It’s how we win clients, deliver campaigns, lead our industry and build our careers.<br><br>
			It empowers us to harness motion for our clients, to adapt to change as it happens, and let brands and stories live and evolve in real time. It underpins everything we do: differentiation in how we sell, competitive edge in how we deliver, and forward progress for the brands we represent. Here's how it works.
