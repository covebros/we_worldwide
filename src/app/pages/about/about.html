						<h3>The Starting point</h3>
						<p>How do we cut through the noise? What should we invest in? How exactly does this help my brand again?<br><br>
						These are the age-old client questions, but in a changing world they need new answers. Every brand today faces a world in motion: stories, stakeholders, competitors and culture constantly changing and always on the move. It’s a speed of change that the old, static methods can’t cope with.<br><br>
						When brands and businesses face disruption and dislocation, everyday reality changes cannot be avoided: the only option is to move with it.</p>
