							<h3>The Starting point</h3>
							<p>How do we cut through the noise? What should we invest in? How exactly does this help my brand again?<br><br>
							These are the age-old client questions, but in a changing world they need new answers. Every brand today faces a world in motion: stories, stakeholders, competitors and culture constantly changing and always on the move. It’s a speed of change that the old, static methods can’t cope with.<br><br>
							When brands and businesses face disruption and dislocation, everyday reality changes cannot be avoided: the only option is to move with it.</p>

							<h3>Our response</h3>
							<p>That’s why we have developed a new approach to meet the challenges posed by a world of brands and stories in motion. It’s a toolkit for delivering in a rapidly changing, demanding environment. A methodology that underpins everything WE is and everything WE does, every day. It’s how we win clients, deliver campaigns, lead our industry and build our careers.<br><br>
							It empowers us to harness motion for our clients, to adapt to change as it happens, and to let brands and stories live and evolve in real time. It underpins everything we do: differentiation in how we sell, competitive edge in how we deliver, and forward progress for the brands we represent. Here's how it works.

							<h3>I. Our thinking: BRANDS IN MOTION</h3>
							<p><span class="bold-text">Brands in Motion (BiM)</span> is our view on the world, one that says traditional brand positioning is dead and clients can only succeed by harnessing motion.</p><br>
							<h4>For pitches and presentations:</h4>
							<p>It informs how we think about a prospect’s audiences, competitors and surrounding universe. It means we shape ideas around how they move the brand forward in light of these factors; and we build campaigns that will evolve and thrive in an environment of constant change.</p><br>
							<h4>For client campaigns:</h4>
							<p>It means we are constantly re-assessing the circumstances in which we harness the motion of the brands we represent. Every day we are looking for what has changed, what is about to change and how we should respond.</p>

							<h3>II. Our methodology: MOMENTUM</h3>
							<p><span class="bold-text">Momentum</span> is how we deliver on the opportunity of Brands in Motion. It is the organizing principle for everything that happens at WE: from delivering for current clients to winning future ones and building our own careers.</p><br>
							<h4>For pitches and presentations:</h4>
							<p>It provides a framework to develop and present our ideas, from establishing context and key insights, to the inspiration of a big idea, the action that will deliver it and how we measure impact.</p><br>
							<h4>For client campaigns:</h4>
							<p>It is the way we structure, scrutinize and report back on our work, providing criteria to be constantly re-assessed against changing realities and the results we deliver. Momentum is not a one-off planning tool; it is an everyday yardstick for progress and impact.</p>

							<h3>III. Our output: STORIES IN MOTION</h3>
							<p><span class="bold-text">Stories in Motion (SiM)</span> are what we deliver as a result of Momentum: content that lives, grows and amplifies in real-time across the media ecosystem, paid, earned and owned; and through different channels, devices and time-zones.</p><br>
							<h4>For pitches and presentations:</h4>
							<p>SiM allows us to demonstrate how a brand can harness its motion, delivering threads of content that are not static but flexible, growing off the conversation and engagement that they provoke. They are the proof points for how brands in motion should operate.</p><br>
							<h4>For client campaigns:</h4>
							<p>SiM is what we create, curate, and analyze to harness motion for our clients. Every piece of work should be conceived and considered as a story in motion: is it channel-agnostic, does it have the flexibility to evolve, can it be openly owned, and will it engage the right audiences?</p>
