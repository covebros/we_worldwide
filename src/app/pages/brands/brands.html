			Thanks to technology, brands today operate in an accelerated environment affected by a range of factors including socio-political complexities, economic uncertainties, direct competitors, disruptors, stakeholders, organisational culture and cultural zeitgeist.<br><br>
			Because of this, traditional brand positioning no longer applies. It is a flawed construct that assumes a static view of consumer perceptions. Today's environment requires an understanding of the concept of motion.<br><br> 
			As part of the BiM study, we asked consumers and B2B decision makers to rate 30 brands across 8 industry categories based on a series of emotional and rational questions.<br><br>
			Using this data, we created the Motion Matrix, a tool designed to help you keep track of the rational and emotional drivers that affect the choices and perceptions of your clientâ€™s audience, and counsel them on how to embrace motion to become an industry leader.

			The ultimate measure of progress is improving how clients are emotionally and rationally perceived by their consumers, leading to tangible business impact. This is represented by movement across the Motion Matrix.
