			A world inspired and influenced by technology is one where every brand is in motion and must adapt to an accelerated environment full of change, threat and opportunity.<br><br>
			Brands never really had control, but nor have they ever felt this out of control. Disruption and dislocation are ever-present: geopolitical complexity, economic uncertainty, competitor agility, cultural zeitgeist, regulatory shifts and consumer caprice combine to create a constant tide of change that brands must adapt and evolve within. Expectations are exponential, we believe we can do more, have more, solve moreâ€¦ and there will be a next version (we can be everywhere with mobile, access anything with the cloud and be more with AI).<br><br>In such an environment, there can be no such thing as static brand positioning. There is only the reality of brand motion, and the question of how to harness it.<br><br>
			To discover how, we conducted research to identify the rational and emotional drivers that create motion for brands. 18,000 consumers, across 6 markets, helped us create the Motion Matrix, a framework for brands to understand what their situation is, where their motion is taking them and how we can harness Momentum to move forwards. Motion is built from the ground up, exactly the same way we have to harness it.

			This is our starting point for planning every new business pitch and client campaign. It enables us to understand what the status-quo looks like for each brand, and how we can work to harness motion. The motion matrix, and the world that created it, demand a better methodology to play: Momentum. <br><br>
