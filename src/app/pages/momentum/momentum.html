			What is Mome
		</single-subheading-title>
		<single-subheading-text>
			Momentum is the basis for everything that is planned, pitched and delivered every day at WE. It is our unique method for helping our clients harness their motion and make progress in a chaotic world; a framework that allows us to keep evolving, delivering and improving what we do.<br><br>
			For clients it is a means to understand the way we work and the value we add. For us, it is a repeatable method to develop, deliver and measure brilliant work. Momentum ensures that everything we do at WE is rooted in credible insight, delivered with maximum impact, and measured in a way that allows us to do even better in the future.<br><br> 
			It is the key to everything from answering new briefs to rebooting long-standing ones. A temperature check that ensures we bring our best thinking and work to every assignment.

					<h3>The Methodology</h3>
					<p>Our Momentum method consists of five stages: from the context in which a brand operates, to the critical insights on which the work is built, the creative inspiration that powers purposeful action, and the necessity of constant measurement.</p>

							<td class="bold-text">The Objective</td>
							<td>Understand and map the operational, cultural, competitive, and regulatory environment the  organization lives and works in.</td>
							<td>Define what really matters and what is doable to impact the desired audience.</td>
							<td>Create a way to deliver on the insight(s) that will inspire audiences to act. What is the overall expression and what are the core components to support it?</td>
							<td>Activate across the most powerful media ecosystem, and create a prioritized plan of action.</td>
							<td>Measure content performance in real-time (as much as possible). Optimize and refine content based on strengths and weaknesses.</td>

							<td class="bold-text">The Motive</td>
							<td><span class="bold-grey-text">Lack of control is an opportunity</span><br><br>In today’s environment, we have to be that much more connected to what is happening and what key trends are developing.</td>
							<td><span class="bold-grey-text">Stability is a part of motion</span><br><br> Audiences are looking for clients to make sense of chaos (environmental, political) AND keep moving forward in a valuable way.</td>
							<td><span class="bold-grey-text">Cutting-edge is transcendent</span><br><br> Today ‘cutting-edge’ means more than product for our clients – it has to include social value and purpose.</td>
							<td><span class="bold-grey-text">The motion matrix, driven by stories in motion</span><br><br> To move across the Matrix we have to balance both emotional and rational components, we need a cohesive journey that continues to evolve. Motion requires consistent work, consistent engagement with the forces exerted on the brand. To move our clients to an industry-leading position we need Stories in Motion.</td>
							<td><span class="bold-grey-text">Love you today, shame you tomorrow</span> <br><br> As audiences can “love you today/shame you tomorrow,” WE needs to excite audiences enough to go on a journey with the brand. Real-time measurement allows us to ensure what we do next keeps that journey going.</td>
