			Momentum is the basis for everything that is planned, pitched and delivered every day at WE. It is our unique method for helping our clients harness their motion and make progress in a chaotic world; a framework that allows us to keep evolving, delivering and improving what we do.<br><br>
			For clients it is a means to understand the way we work and the value we add. For us, it is a repeatable method to develop, deliver and measure brilliant work. Momentum ensures that everything we do at WE is rooted in credible insight, delivered with maximum impact, and measured in a way that allows us to do even better in the future.<br><br> 
			It is the key to everything from answering new briefs to rebooting long-standing ones. A temperature check that ensures we bring our best thinking and work to every assignment.
