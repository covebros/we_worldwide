		What is Momentum?
	</single-subheading-title>
	<single-subheading-text>
		As communicators, we are living in a world of constant motion, as much as the brands we advise and the stories we tell. We must constantly adapt and evolve to help clients do the same, keeping up or leading their audiences. And that’s where Momentum comes in.<br><br>
		Momentum is the heart of how we work. The framework that allows us to keep evolving, delivering and improving what we do. A blueprint that ensures we are always guided by insight, driven by creativity, motivated in action and rigorous in measuring impact.<br><br> 
		Momentum is about helping you to do your job better, to give more confident advice and to achieve even better results than before. It means we can always be focused not on the process, but on making progress.

		Momentum is needed because the clients we work with exist in a world of constant motion, in environments that are moving at an accelerated, unstoppable pace. Their reputation is at the mercy of many factors, from regulation and policy to culture, competition and more and they need a reliable framework which helps them understand and navigate these factors.

		Momentum makes sense of this chaos and lets brands harness their motion.

		Momentum methodology: 5 steps
	</single-subheading-title>
	<single-subheading-text>
		Our Momentum method consists of five stages: from the context in which a brand operates, to the critical insights on which the work is built, the creative inspiration that powers everyday work, and the necessity of constant measurement.

		How does it work?
	</single-subheading-title>
	<single-subheading-text>
		Momentum doesn’t begin and end at pitch. It’s an approach that needs to underpin all our work, from developing new briefs to rebooting long-standing ones. Think of momentum as a constant temperature check: ensuring we’re bringing our best thinking and work to every assignment.
