			  	<h3>Ever been asked...</h3>
				<p>
					Can we get a crazy, whacky, out of the box idea?<br>
					What is our ROI?<br>
					Is this really going to work for our audiences?<br>
					What is the strategy…not just the tactics?<br>
					Will these tactics work, why these?<br>
					With all these channels, which one do we prioritize?<br>
					Why do we need comms when we have big marketing and advertising spend?<br>
					How do we cut through the noise?<br>

				<h3>Ever wanted to:</h3>
				<p>
					Go beyond the usual?<br>
					Feel like a partner rather than a vendor?<br>
					Deliver and innovate for your clients?<br>
					Be energized by your work, not dreading the inbox?<br>
					Satisfy your curiosity?<br>
					Have the right—sometimes tough—conversations with your clients?<br>
					Be bold, be fearless?<br>
					Have more fun?
