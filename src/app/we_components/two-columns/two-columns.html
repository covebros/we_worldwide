								<h3>Internally</h3>
								<h4>To assemble a top class team.</h4>
								<p>The Momentum methodology ensures we bring the right people together and prioritize our agency perspective over preconceived ideas from us or the client.</p><br>
								<h4>To design and structure presentations and decks.</h4>
								<p>In terms of presenting information, the five pillars of Momentum are to be used as agendas/contents to guide the conversation.</p><br>
								<h4>To internally plan and project manage programs.</h4>
								<p>All timelines need to account for work in each of the five pillars – the work is sequential and we can’t skip a step even if we are pressed for time.</p><br>
								<h4>To unlock selling opportunities and introduce new services to clients.</h4>
								<p>Billable products and services exist across all five pillars of Momentum. Clients don’t always pay for everything up front, but revisiting the methodology presents opportunities to introduce new products and services.</p>
